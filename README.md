Bichon is an open-source email archiving system that **synchronizes emails from IMAP servers**, **indexes them for full-text search**, and provides a **REST API** for programmatic access.
**Unlike email clients**, Bichon is designed for **archiving and searching** rather than sending/receiving emails. It runs as a **standalone server application** that continuously synchronizes configured email accounts and maintains a **searchable local archive**.
Built in Rust, it requires no external dependencies and provides fast, efficient email archiving, management, and search through a built-in WebUI. Its name is inspired by the puppy my daughter adopted last month.

## 🐾 Why Create Bichon?

A few months ago, I released **rustmailer**, an email API middleware:  
https://github.com/rustmailer/rustmailer

Since then, I’ve received many emails asking whether it could also archive emails, perform unified search, and support full-text indexing—not just querying recipients.  
But rustmailer was designed as a middleware focused on providing API services.  
Adding archiving and full-text search would complicate its core purpose and go far beyond its original scope.

Meanwhile, I realized that email archiving itself only requires a small portion of rustmailer’s functionality, plus a search engine.  
With that combination, building a dedicated, efficient archiver becomes much simpler.

Using the experience gained from rustmailer, I designed and built **Bichon** in less than two weeks, followed by another two weeks of testing and optimization.  
It has now reached a stable, usable state—and I decided to release it publicly.

**Bichon is completely free**.  
You can download and use it however you like.  
It’s not perfect, but I hope it brings you value.

## Star History

[![Star History Chart](https://api.star-history.com/svg?repos=rustmailer/bichon&type=date&legend=top-left)](https://www.star-history.com/#rustmailer/bichon&type=date&legend=top-left)


## 🚀 Quick Start

### Docker Deployment (Recommended)

```bash
# Pull the image
docker pull rustmailer/bichon:latest

# Create data directory
mkdir -p ./bichon-data

# Run container
docker run -d \
  --name bichon \
  -p 15630:15630 \
  -v $(pwd)/bichon-data:/data \
  -e BICHON_LOG_LEVEL=info \
  -e BICHON_ROOT_DIR=/data \
  rustmailer/bichon:latest
```

## CORS Configuration (Important for Browser Access)

Starting from **v0.1.4**, Bichon changes how `BICHON_CORS_ORIGINS` works:

### **🔄 New Behavior in v0.1.4**

* If **`BICHON_CORS_ORIGINS` is not set**, Bichon now **allows all origins**.
  This makes local testing and simple deployments much easier.
* If you **do set** `BICHON_CORS_ORIGINS`, then **you must explicitly list each allowed origin**.
* `*` is **not supported** and will **not work** — you must provide exact URLs.

#### How CORS Matching Works

When a browser accesses Bichon, it will send an `Origin` header.

* **Incoming Origin** = the exact address the browser is using
* **Configured origins** = the list you passed to `BICHON_CORS_ORIGINS`

If Configured origins does not contain the Incoming Origin exactly as a full string match, the browser request will be rejected.

Example debug log:

```
2025-12-06T23:56:30.422+08:00 DEBUG bichon::modules::rest: CORS: Incoming Origin = "http://localhost:15630"
2025-12-06T23:56:30.422+08:00 DEBUG bichon::modules::rest: CORS: Configured origins = ["http://192.168.3.2:15630"]
```

In this example:

* Browser is using `http://localhost:15630`
* But the configured origin is `http://192.168.3.2:15630`

→ **CORS will fail**, and you can immediately see why.

#### When Should You Configure CORS?

It is strongly recommended to configure CORS in production environments to ensure that only trusted browser origins can access Bichon.
If you want to access Bichon from a browser:

* Add the exact **IP** with port
* Or the exact **hostname** with port
* Or the **domain** (port optional if it's 80)

Examples:

```
http://192.168.1.16:15630
http://myserver.local:15630
http://mydomain.com
```

If you access Bichon in **multiple different ways**, list all of them:

```
-e BICHON_CORS_ORIGINS="http://192.168.1.16:15630,http://myserver.local:15630,http://mydomain.com"
```

> **Do not add a trailing slash**
> (`http://192.168.1.16:15630/` will not match)
>
> **Do not use `*`**, it is not supported.

#### How to Enable Debug Logs (Highly Recommended for CORS Issues)

Set environment variable:

```
BICHON_LOG_LEVEL=debug
```

Or via command-line:

```
--bichon-log-level debug
```

Default is `info`, so CORS logs will not appear unless debug logging is enabled.

#### ⚠️ Note on Running Bichon in a Container

> ⚠️ **Note:** If you are running Bichon in a container (via **Docker Compose** or **docker run**), be careful with **quotes in environment variable values**.

For example, **do not** write:

```bash
-e BICHON_CORS_ORIGINS="http://localhost:15630,http://myserver.local:15630"
```

* The outer quotes (`"`) will be passed literally into the container and may cause CORS misconfiguration.

**Correct way:**

```bash
-e BICHON_CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:15630,http://myserver.local:15630
```

Or using YAML literal style for Docker Compose:

```yaml
environment:
  BICHON_CORS_ORIGINS: |
    http://localhost:15630,http://myserver.local:15630
```

This ensures that the configured origins are interpreted correctly inside the container.

> ⚠️ **Note:** This fucking problem I actually didn’t know about myself; thanks to [gall-1](https://github.com/gall-1) for pointing it out.

## 🔐 Setting the Bichon Encryption Password

Please refer to the following documentation for detailed instructions on how to set the Bichon encryption password:

👉 [https://github.com/rustmailer/bichon/wiki/Setting-the-Bichon-Encryption-Password](https://github.com/rustmailer/bichon/wiki/Setting-the-Bichon-Encryption-Password)

All configuration methods, including command-line options, environment variables, and password file support (v0.2.0+), are documented there.

## 🔑 User Authentication & Admin Account

Starting from **Bichon v0.2.0**, the authentication model has been updated.

### Built-in Admin User (v0.2.0+)

* Bichon no longer uses the legacy single-account `root / root` login.
* The system now ships with a built-in **admin** user by default.
* **Default credentials:**

  * **Username:** `admin`
  * **Password:** `admin@bichon`

> The legacy `root` account and the `root / root` default credentials **no longer exist**.


### Mandatory Access Token Authentication

* From **v0.2.0 onward**, **access-token–based authentication is always enabled**.
* The startup flag and environment variable
  `--bichon-enable-access-token` / `BICHON_ENABLE_ACCESS_TOKEN`
  are **deprecated and no longer used**.
* No additional configuration is required to enable authentication.


### Managing Account Information

After logging in, the admin user can manage their profile directly in the WebUI:

1. Log in to the WebUI using the default admin credentials.
2. Navigate to **Settings → Profile**.
3. Update:

   * Username
   * Password
   * Avatar and other profile information

⚠️ **Security Notice:**
For security reasons, you should **change the default admin password immediately after the first login**.

## 🧑‍💻 Developer Guide

To build or contribute to Bichon, the following environment is recommended:

### Prerequisites
- **Rust**: Use the latest stable toolchain for best compatibility and performance.
- **Node.js**: Version **20+** is required.
- **pnpm**: Recommended package manager for the WebUI.

### Steps

#### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rustmailer/bichon.git
cd bichon
```

#### 2. Build the WebUI

```bash
cd web
pnpm install
pnpm run build
```

Run the WebUI in development mode if needed:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

#### 3. Build or Run the Backend

After the WebUI is built, return to the project root:

```bash
cd ..
cargo build
```

Or run directly:

```bash
export BICHON_ENCRYPT_PASSWORD=dummy-password-for-testing
cargo run -- --bichon-root-dir e:\bichon-data
```

`--bichon-root-dir` specifies the directory where **all Bichon data** will be stored.
`BICHON_ENCRYPT_PASSWORD` is the password used to encrypt the sensitive data (see `cargo run -- --help` for alternative ways to specify this).

### WebUI Access

* The WebUI runs on **[http://localhost:15630](http://localhost:15630)** by default.
* **HTTPS is not enabled** in development or default builds.
